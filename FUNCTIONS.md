Error: Missing required [original] content. Cannot apply diff without the original source code to modify.

The provided diff appears to be creating a new markdown documentation file (FUNCTIONS.md) rather than modifying existing code. To properly merge changes, I need both:

1. The original source code content
2. A diff showing the changes to be applied to that code

Please provide the original code content so I can accurately apply the changes.
