  description: |
    - Design Constraints - read Agent Design Principles, all designs must be constrained by those principles
    - Compare any proposed solution against the original code, do not lose any functionality, do not overdesign, stick to the principles
    - NEVER lose existing functionality, or break existing code
    Intent - the logging is too long, i want to better control the volukme of log
    - we are running this through prefect_runnder, so it needs to support mulit modal logging flags --log debug|trace|default
    If debug is enabled then print out the full prompt
    If trace i'm interested mainly in the trace of the logic flow, and enough content to get context, then only show the first 100 and last 100 characters, make this configurable
    If default set or no opting given, give minimal logging, such as warnings & errors, and final result
    only updated the logging, dont lose functionality
    makde sure the command line is honored by the agents
