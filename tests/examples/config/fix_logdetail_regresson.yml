          Fix LogDetail regression in BaseAgent while maintaining backwards compatibility.

          Current Issue:
          When removing _process_llm_response from BaseAgent, we broke LogDetail functionality
          used by solution_designer and potentially other agents.

          Required Changes:
          1. In base.py:
             - Keep LogDetail enum with all levels
             - Ensure LogDetail is properly exported
             - Move any remaining functionality from _process_llm_response to _process_response
             - Maintain all existing functionality and interfaces

          2. In solution_designer.py:
             - Update imports to use LogDetail from base
             - Use _process_response instead of _process_llm_response
             - Keep all existing functionality
             - Preserve response format and handling

          Constraints:
          - No loss of existing functionality
          - Maintain backward compatibility
          - Keep all logging capabilities
          - Preserve response formats
          - All logging levels must still work

          Files to Modify:
          1. c4h_agents/agents/base.py
          2. c4h_agents/agents/solution_designer.py

          The changes should:
          - Fix the LogDetail undefined error
          - Keep all existing logging functionality
          - Maintain the same response processing capabilities
          - Not break any dependent code
