    - Design Constraints - read Agent Design Principles, all designs must be constrained by those principles
    - Compare any proposed solution against the original code, do not lose any functionality, do not overdesign, stick to the principles
    Intent - review base agent design
    Implement a new skill, semantic_formater.py
    it takes a blob of text with a prompt and returns a response
    Model it in semantic_extractor.py, it will need its own configuration section added to the system_config.yml
    Do NOT break current config backwards compatibility
    Do NOT lose exisiting functionality
    both semantic_extractor and now semantic_formater are single shot skills
    that take a blob with a configured prompt according to its configuration
