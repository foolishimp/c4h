# WO-trefac-02 Implementation Summary

## Summary

This work order involved refactoring the Discovery agent in the C4H system to follow the principles of the C4H Unified Architecture (Version 3.0). Specifically, the tasks were:

1. Remove hardcoded tartxt.py execution from GenericLLMAgent (TASK-AGENT-R-001)
2. Implement tartxt.py functionality as a registered Skill (TASK-AGENT-R-002)
3. Create a new Persona for skill-based discovery (TASK-AGENT-R-003)
4. Update configurations to use the new approach (TASK-AGENT-R-004)

## Implementation Details

### TASK-AGENT-R-001: Remove special handling from GenericLLMAgent

- Status: **Complete**
- The special handling for tartxt.py execution in the GenericLLMAgent has been removed
- Verification: Confirmed that the GenericLLMAgent code no longer contains any tartxt-specific execution logic

### TASK-AGENT-R-002: Implement tartxt.py as a registered Skill

- Status: **Complete**
- The tartxt.py functionality is now available through the CommandLineRunner skill
- CommandLineRunner is a generic skill that can execute any command-line tool
- It correctly handles tartxt.py's command-line interface and arguments
- Verification: Conducted direct tests of the CommandLineRunner skill with tartxt.py 

### TASK-AGENT-R-003: Create a new Persona for skill-based discovery

- Status: **Complete**
- Created a new persona configuration at `/config/personas/discovery_by_skill_v1.yml`
- The persona is configured to:
  - Use GenericSkillAgent as its agent type
  - Use the command_line_runner skill
  - Pass appropriate parameters to execute tartxt.py with the project path
  - Handle positional arguments correctly for tartxt.py
  - Configure output file path and working directory
- Verification: Tested persona configuration loading

### TASK-AGENT-R-004: Update default discovery task configuration

- Status: **Complete**
- Updated the discovery task configuration in `system_config.yml` to:
  - Use GenericSkillAgent instead of GenericLLMAgent
  - Reference the new discovery_by_skill_v1 persona
  - Update task description to reflect the skill-based approach 
- Verification: Configured system_config.yml was validated

## Testing

- Created and ran the test script `tests/test_discovery_skill_agent.py`
- Verified CommandLineRunner skill can correctly execute tartxt.py
- Confirmed the skill handles positional arguments and parameter passing correctly
- Output file is created at the expected location

## Implementation Notes

1. **Command-line Interface**: The tartxt.py script expects the project path as a positional argument, not as a --project_path flag, which required special handling in the skill configuration.

2. **Skill Parameter Passing**: The parameters need to be structured correctly for the CommandLineRunner skill to pass them properly to the underlying command.

3. **Path Variables**: Used template variables like `{{context.project_path}}` and `{{context.workflow_run_id}}` in the persona configuration to ensure dynamic values are properly inserted at runtime.

## Next Steps

- Monitor the usage of the new skill-based discovery agent in production
- Consider further refining the tartxt.py script's interface to better align with the skill-based approach
- Apply similar refactoring techniques to other agents that may have hardcoded functionality
