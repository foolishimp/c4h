# Implementation Summary for WO-trefac-01

## Completed Work

1. **BaseAgent Config Method Documentation Updates**
   - Updated docstrings and comments in all configuration-related methods in `BaseAgent` to clearly indicate they are NOT intended for override in the generic agent model:
     - `_get_system_message`
     - `_get_prompt`
     - `_format_request`
     - `_get_agent_name`
     - `_get_workflow_run_id`
     - `_get_required_keys`
     - `process`

2. **GenericOrchestratingAgent Resolution**
   - Confirmed that `GenericOrchestratingAgent` has been replaced by `GenericOrchestratorAgent`
   - Updated comments in the code to provide clarity about the naming change
   - Ensured the replacement provides equivalent functionality as required in the workorder

3. **Legacy Agent Files**
   - Confirmed that legacy agent implementation files that were to be deleted are already removed:
     - All old specific agent classes like `coder.py`, `discovery.py`, `solution_designer.py`, etc. are not present in the codebase

4. **Technical Debt Resolution: Generic Command Line Skill**
   - Implemented a generic `CommandLineRunner` skill to replace the specialized `TartXTRunner` skill
   - Configured the skill registry to properly register the new skill with default config for tartxt
   - Created an example persona configuration (`discovery_generic_v1.yml`) to demonstrate usage
   - Added test cases to verify that the `CommandLineRunner` can correctly execute tartxt
   - Enhanced implementation to support tartxt's git and history parameters
   - Added support for default arguments in command configurations
   - Created comprehensive documentation for migration from TartXTRunner
   - Preserved backward compatibility while enabling a more generic and reusable approach

## Verification

- The updated BaseAgent implementation correctly initializes all attributes from `full_effective_config` and `unique_name`
- Generic agents (`GenericLLMAgent`, `GenericOrchestratorAgent`, `GenericSkillAgent`, `GenericFallbackAgent`) all operate solely based on the configuration snapshot and agent name
- All configuration access methods now have clear documentation indicating they should not be overridden
- Legacy patterns have been removed in favor of the new configuration-driven approach

## Future Considerations

- Monitor usage patterns to ensure teams are using the generic agent classes correctly
- Update documentation to guide teams toward using the generic agents with appropriate configuration rather than creating custom agent subclasses
- Consider automated tests to verify that agents are using the correct configuration paths
