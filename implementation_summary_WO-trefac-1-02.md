# Implementation Summary: WO-trefac.1-02 - Enforce Immutable Context Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Immutability in Context Updates

#### Previous Implementation
The code used shallow dictionary unpacking for context updates:
```python
next_context = {**current_context, **context_updates}
current_context = next_context
```

#### New Implementation
Enhanced with deep copying to ensure true immutability, preventing shared references between old and new context objects:
```python
from copy import deepcopy

# First create a deep copy of the current context
next_context = deepcopy(current_context)

# Then apply updates with deep copies to prevent shared references
for key, value in context_updates.items():
    next_context[key] = deepcopy(value)
    
current_context = next_context
```

### 2. Comprehensive Context Structure Documentation

Added detailed documentation in key functions:

#### In `run_declarative_workflow()`
Added comprehensive context structure conventions documentation explaining:
- `data_context`: Contains the evolving payload/results of the workflow
- `execution_metadata`: Contains information about the workflow execution itself
- `config`: Reference to the effective configuration snapshot

### 3. Consistent Immutability Documentation

Updated docstrings across multiple functions to consistently document the immutability pattern:
- `run_declarative_workflow`
- `execute_team_subflow`
- `execute_loop_team`
- `run_agent_task`

Each function now clearly states:
1. That context is treated as immutable
2. The function does not modify the input context directly
3. Updates are returned rather than modifying input context

### 4. Enhanced Loop and Iteration Context Handling

Updated loop iteration context creation to use deepcopy rather than shallow dictionary unpacking:
```python
from copy import deepcopy
iter_context = deepcopy(current_context)
iter_context[loop_variable] = item
iter_context["loop_index"] = idx
iter_context["loop_count"] = len(collection)
```

### 5. Task Context Creation

Updated task context creation to use deepcopy for true immutability:
```python
from copy import deepcopy
task_context = deepcopy(current_context)
task_context["task_config"] = deepcopy(task_config_def)
```

## Verification

1. **Confirmed `run_declarative_workflow` Immutability**: 
   - Now properly creates deeply immutable context updates
   - Deep copying prevents shared references between old and new contexts

2. **Verified `evaluate_routing_task` Immutability**:
   - Already correctly treats context as immutable
   - Returns context_updates as a separate dictionary without modifying input context

3. **Confirmed `Team.execute` Immutability**:
   - Already treats context as immutable input
   - Documentation explicitly states immutability principles

## Summary

These changes enforce true immutability in context updates throughout the orchestration workflow, as required by REQ-DET-05. By using deep copying rather than shallow dictionary merging, we ensure that nested dictionaries and other mutable objects are properly copied rather than shared between contexts. The enhanced documentation clearly establishes context structure conventions and immutability principles across all relevant components.
