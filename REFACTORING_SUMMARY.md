# C4H System Refactoring - Phase 1: Core Engine and Configuration Model

## Overview

This refactoring implements the foundational components of the C4H Unified Architecture (Version 3.0) as specified in the workorder. The primary focus is on establishing a universal "Execution Plan Executor" and refining the configuration model to support recursive, declarative orchestration.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Universal Execution Plan Executor

The core of the refactoring is the implementation of a universal execution plan executor in `c4h_agents/execution/executor.py`. This component provides:

- Execution of plans at all levels (workflow, team, agent)
- Support for various step types:
  - `skill_call`: Execute skills from the registry
  - `agent_call`: Call other agents
  - `team_call`: Trigger team-level plans
  - `llm_call`: Direct LLM invocation
  - `loop`: Iteration over collections
  - `branch`: Conditional logic and routing
  - `set_value`: Setting context values
- Context management with immutability guarantees
- Error handling and retries
- Integration with event logging and lineage tracking

### 2. JSON Schema for Execution Plans

A comprehensive JSON schema for execution plans has been defined in `config/schemas/execution_plan_v1.json`. This schema enforces the structure of execution plans and ensures their validity across all levels of the system.

### 3. Enhanced Skill Registry

The skill registry has been enhanced to support centralized registration and lookup of skills:

- Auto-discovery of skills in the skills package
- Registration of skills from configuration
- Built-in skills for core functionality
- Instantiation with configuration parameters
- Support for lookup by name and tag

### 4. Configuration Validation and Materialization

The configuration system has been enhanced with validation and materialization capabilities:

- Schema validation for execution plans
- Cross-reference validation (skills, agents, teams)
- Configuration materialization for runtime usage
- Agent type resolution
- Skill registry integration

### 5. Prefect Integration

Prefect wrappers have been added to support workflow orchestration:

- Task for executing execution plans
- Flow for running execution plans with context
- Task for executing skills
- Flow for running skills with parameters

### 6. Agent Support for Execution Plans

The `BaseAgent` class has been updated to support execution plans:

- Detection of execution plans in configuration
- Execution of plans using the executor
- Integration with lineage context
- Fallback to traditional LLM processing

### 7. TartXT Runner Skill

A dedicated skill for project scanning and content extraction has been created in `c4h_agents/skills/tartxt_runner.py`, removing the special-case logic from `GenericLLMAgent`.

## Testing

A test script has been added in `tests/test_execution_plan.py` to verify the functionality of the execution plan executor and related components.

## Architecture Principles

The implementation adheres to the following architecture principles:

- **Statelessness**: Components do not maintain mutable internal state.
- **Immutability**: Context and configuration objects are treated as immutable.
- **Explicit Data Flow**: Data flows explicitly through context and parameters.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Behavior is defined through configuration rather than code.
- **Recursive Orchestration**: Execution plans can invoke other execution plans at different levels.

## Future Enhancements

Future phases can build upon this foundation to implement:

- More sophisticated orchestration patterns
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Additional step types for specialized operations
- UI for designing and visualizing execution plans
- Execution monitoring and metrics

This refactoring sets the stage for a more flexible, maintainable, and robust C4H system architecture.
